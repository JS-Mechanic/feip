**Why javascript and web developers in general decided to use `array` and `object` (reference types) over others?**  
JavaScript and web developers in general decided to use arrays and objects (reference types) over others for several reasons:

* **Efficiency:** Arrays and objects are more efficient to use than primitive data types like strings and numbers because they allow developers to store and manipulate multiple values together. This can save memory and improve performance, especially when working with large datasets.
* **Flexibility:** Arrays and objects are more flexible than primitive data types because they allow developers to store a variety of data types, including other arrays and objects. This makes them well-suited for modeling real-world data, which is often complex and interconnected.
* **Code Re-usability:** Arrays and objects are often used to create reusable components that can be shared between different parts of a web application. This can save time and improve code quality.

Here are some specific examples of how arrays and objects are used in web development:

* **Arrays** are used to store lists of data, such as lists of products, users, or comments. They can also be used to store data structures like matrices and queues.
* **Objects** are used to store collections of data with key-value pairs, such as user profiles, product information, or configuration settings. They can also be used to create custom data structures like trees and graphs.

In addition to the benefits mentioned above, arrays and objects are also relatively easy to use in JavaScript. This is because they are built into the language and have a wide range of methods and properties that make it easy to manipulate data.

**Javascript reference types pros and cons?**  
JavaScript reference types, such as arrays and objects, offer several advantages over primitive data types like strings and numbers. However, they also come with some drawbacks.

**Pros of Reference Types:**

1. **Efficient Memory Usage:** Reference types allow for storing multiple values within a single data structure, reducing the need for multiple declarations and improving memory utilization.

2. **Data Structure Representation:** Reference types effectively represent complex data structures like lists, trees, and graphs, enabling the organization and manipulation of intricate data relationships.

3. **Dynamic Data Handling:** Reference types can dynamically accommodate new data elements or properties without the need for pre-defined structures, making them adaptable to changing data requirements.

4. **Code Re-usability:** Reference types can be encapsulated into reusable components, promoting code sharing and reducing development time.

5. **Object-Oriented Programming:** Reference types are the foundation of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, enabling the creation of classes, inheritance, and encapsulation for modular and maintainable code.

**Cons of Reference Types:**

1. **Memory Management Overhead:** Reference types require additional memory management overhead compared to primitive data types, as the references themselves need to be stored and tracked.

2. **Potential for Memory Leaks:** Improper handling of reference types can lead to memory leaks, where unused objects continue to occupy memory, causing performance issues.

3. **Complex Data Access:** Accessing specific elements or properties within complex data structures can be more cumbersome compared to directly accessing primitive data values.

4. **Potential for Mutation:** Reference types allow for in-place mutation, which can lead to unintended changes to the underlying data if not handled carefully.

5. **Increased Verbosity:** Working with complex reference types can involve more code and verbosity compared to using primitive data types for simple data handling.

**Explain Regenerating vs. Re-rendering in ReactJS?**  
In ReactJS, regeneration and re-rendering are two distinct processes that play crucial roles in maintaining the dynamic and responsive nature of web applications. While both involve updating the UI based on changes in data or state, they differ in their approach and implications.

**Regeneration** refers to the process of recreating a React component from scratch. This involves reconstructing the component's virtual DOM representation, which is an in-memory representation of the component's structure and content. Regeneration typically occurs when a component's props or state undergo significant changes, requiring a complete rebuild of the component's structure.

**Re-rendering**, on the other hand, involves updating the UI without recreating the entire component. This is achieved by efficiently applying the changes to the existing virtual DOM representation. Re-rendering is more performant as it avoids the overhead of reconstructing the entire component from scratch. It is commonly used for minor updates to component props or state.

To illustrate the difference, consider a scenario where a React component displays a list of items. When the list of items changes, the component needs to update the UI accordingly. Regeneration would involve recreating the entire list component, including each individual item element. Re-rendering, on the other hand, would only update the items that have changed, leaving the rest of the component intact.

In general, re-rendering is preferred over regeneration due to its performance benefits and reduced impact on the UI. However, regeneration may be necessary for more complex component updates or when the existing component structure is no longer suitable. React's reconciliation algorithm automatically determines whether regeneration or re-rendering is required for each component, optimizing performance and maintaining a smooth user experience.

**Explain React Server Components feature?**  
React Server Components (RSCs) are a new feature in React that allows you to render React components on the server. This means that the HTML for your components can be generated on the server and sent to the client, rather than having to be generated in the browser. RSCs can offer several advantages over traditional client-side rendering, including:

* **Improved performance:** By rendering components on the server, you can reduce the amount of work that the client needs to do, which can lead to faster initial page load times and a smoother user experience.
* **Better SEO:** RSCs can help improve your website's SEO by providing search engines with the HTML for your content immediately, rather than having to wait for the client to render it.
* **Reduced client-side complexity:** RSCs can help to reduce the complexity of your client-side code by moving some of the rendering logic to the server.

Here are some of the key features of RSCs:

* **Streaming:** RSCs can be streamed to the client, which means that the HTML for your components can be sent to the client as soon as it is available, rather than having to wait for the entire component to be rendered.
* **Suspendable:** RSCs can be suspendable, which means that they can pause their rendering until some data is available. This can be useful for components that need to fetch data from the server before they can be rendered.
* **Automatic hydration:** RSCs can be automatically hydrated, which means that React can take the HTML that was rendered on the server and use it to create the corresponding DOM nodes on the client.

**Explain React Suspense feature?**  

React Suspense is a feature of React that allows you to control how components load and display content. It lets you specify a fallback UI to be displayed while a component is loading, and it also lets you control when and how components are rendered. This can make your app feel more responsive and prevent users from seeing loading spinners.

Benefits of using React Suspense:

- **Improved user experience:** React Suspense can make your app feel more responsive by preventing users from seeing loading spinners.
- **Better error handling:** React Suspense lets you control how errors are handled, so you can display custom error messages or retry fetching data.
- **More control over rendering:** React Suspense lets you control when and how components are rendered, which can be useful for optimizing performance.

**Explain(name) best practices of function implementation?**  
Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient functions is essential for developing high-quality software. Here are some best practices to follow for implementing functions effectively:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each function should have a single, well-defined responsibility. This promotes modularity, improves code readability, and facilitates easier testing.

2. **Keep Functions Concise:** Avoid overly large or complex functions. Break down lengthy functions into smaller, more manageable ones. This enhances code readability and maintainability.

3. **Meaningful Function Names:** Use descriptive names that accurately reflect the function's purpose. This makes code self-documenting and improves code understanding.

4. **Proper Argument Handling:** Clearly define function parameters and their expected values. Use type annotations if available to enhance type safety.

5. **Explicit Return Values:** Clearly indicate what a function returns, especially if it returns multiple values. Use meaningful return values to convey the function's outcome.

6. **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent application crashes. Use try-catch blocks or error-throwing mechanisms.

7. **Documentation:** Document non-obvious function behavior, including preconditions, postconditions, and potential side effects. This enhances code clarity and maintainability.

8. **Testing:** Thoroughly test functions to ensure they produce correct results under various input conditions. Use unit tests and integration tests to validate function behavior.

9. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize functions for performance, especially those that are frequently called or performance-critical. Consider factors like time complexity and memory usage.

10. **Code Style and Consistency:** Follow consistent coding style guidelines for indentation, spacing, and naming conventions. This improves code readability and maintainability.

11. **Code Reuse:** Identify opportunities for code reuse. Create reusable helper functions or modules to avoid code duplication and promote code consistency.

12. **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code with peers or mentors to identify potential improvements, refactor code, and ensure adherence to best practices.

By following these best practices, you can write well-structured, efficient, and maintainable functions that contribute to high-quality software development.

**Deep dive into reactjs key prop?**  

- **What is the `key` prop?**  
    The `key` prop is a special prop that you can add to React elements. It is a unique identifier that React uses to efficiently identify and update elements when a component's data changes.

- **Why is the `key` prop important?**  
    The `key` prop is important because it helps React optimize its rendering process. When a component's data changes, React needs to figure out which elements have changed and which ones have not. This can be a computationally expensive task, especially for large lists of elements.

By using the `key` prop, you can give React a hint about which elements are likely to have changed. This makes it easier for React to identify the changed elements and update the UI efficiently.

- **When should I use the `key` prop?**  
    You should use the `key` prop whenever you are rendering a list of elements. This includes arrays, objects, and any other data structures that contain a list of elements.

Here are some examples of when to use the `key` prop:

* When rendering a list of items in a `<ul>` tag
* When rendering a list of cards in a grid layout
* When rendering a list of products in an e-commerce shop

- **What are the rules for using the `key` prop?**  
    The `key` prop must be a unique identifier for each element. This means that no two elements in the same list can have the same `key` prop.   
    The `key` prop can be any string or number value. However, it is recommended to use a unique identifier that is related to the data of the element. For example, you could use the ID of the element, or a unique hash of the element's data.

---

**How to force a React component to re-render using key prop?**  
While the `key` prop in ReactJS is primarily used for optimizing component updates, it can also be indirectly used to force a component re-render. This approach is generally discouraged due to its potential performance implications and should only be employed in specific situations where you need to explicitly trigger a re-render.

**How does using the `key` prop for forcing re-render work?**

When you modify the `key` prop of an element, React considers it a new element and discards the existing instance, leading to a re-render of the component. This behavior stems from React's reconciliation process, which assumes that a change in the `key` prop signifies a significant change in the element's identity.

**Why should you avoid using the `key` prop for forcing re-render?**

Using the `key` prop to force re-render can have detrimental effects on performance, especially for components with complex render logic or large data sets. This is because React will unnecessarily re-render the entire component, even if the underlying data or props haven't changed.

---

**What does this mean? `No one can touch redux state`**  
The statement "No one can touch Redux state" implies that the Redux state is immutable and cannot be directly modified by any component or action. This is a fundamental principle of Redux, as it ensures that state changes are predictable and controlled, preventing inconsistencies and potential bugs.

The statement "No one can touch Redux state" emphasizes the immutability and controlled nature of state changes in Redux. This principle is essential for building predictable, reliable, and maintainable ReactJS applications.

**Explain change detection in javascript vs. change detection in reactJS?**  
Change detection is a fundamental concept in both JavaScript and ReactJS, but it serves different purposes and operates in distinct ways.

- **Change Detection in JavaScript**

In JavaScript, change detection is primarily concerned with tracking changes in the Document Object Model (DOM), the representation of a web page in the browser. When a change occurs in the DOM, such as an element being added, removed, or modified, the browser's event loop triggers the appropriate event handlers. These event handlers can then respond to the changes and update the user interface accordingly.

JavaScript's change detection mechanism is relatively simple and efficient, as it only monitors changes to the DOM itself. This makes it suitable for basic web applications that don't require complex data structures or state management.

- **Change Detection in ReactJS**

ReactJS, on the other hand, employs a more sophisticated change detection mechanism that goes beyond the DOM. It utilizes a virtual DOM (VDOM), an in-memory representation of the DOM, to efficiently detect and manage changes in the underlying data model.

ReactJS's change detection process involves comparing the current VDOM to the updated VDOM after a data change. This comparison identifies the minimum changes required to transform the current UI into the desired UI. By focusing on the specific parts of the VDOM that have changed, ReactJS minimizes the number of DOM manipulations required, resulting in faster and smoother UI updates.

ReactJS's change detection mechanism is particularly well-suited for building complex web applications that handle large amounts of data and require dynamic UI updates. It ensures that the UI remains responsive and up-to-date as the underlying data changes.

**Key Differences**

Here's a table summarizing the key differences between change detection in JavaScript and ReactJS:

| Feature                    | JavaScript                          | ReactJS                                |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Primary focus              | DOM changes                         | Data changes and VDOM                  |
| Change detection mechanism | Event-based                         | Comparison of VDOMs                    |
| Efficiency                 | Suitable for basic web applications | Optimized for complex web applications |

**Tell me about `TDD` and `BDD` in reactjs web app?**  
Test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD) are two popular software development methodologies that can be effectively applied to ReactJS web applications. Both approaches emphasize writing tests before writing code, promoting a shift-left approach to testing and ensuring that the application's behavior is well-defined and tested from the start.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

TDD focuses on creating tests for individual components and features before writing the actual code. This approach encourages developers to think about the desired behavior of the code upfront, ensuring that the implementation meets the specified requirements.

**Key Steps in TDD:**

1. **Red: Write a failing test** - Define a specific test case that describes the desired behavior of a component or feature.

2. **Green: Write the minimum code to pass the test** - Implement the code necessary to make the failing test pass.

3. **Refactor: Improve the code without changing its behavior** - Refactor the code to make it more maintainable, readable, and efficient without altering its functionality.

**Benefits of TDD:**

- **Encourages clear and well-defined requirements**

- **Promotes well-structured and testable code**

- **Reduces the risk of introducing bugs**

- **Facilitates continuous integration and delivery**

**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**

**Explain cypress custom commands?**  
Custom commands are a powerful feature of Cypress that allows you to extend its capabilities and create reusable code blocks for common testing tasks. They can be used to abstract away repetitive actions, simplify test syntax, and improve code readability and maintainability.

**Creating a Custom Command:**

1. **Define the Command:** Create a JavaScript file, typically within the `cypress/support/commands.js` file, to define your custom commands.

2. **Chainable vs. Non-Chainable Commands:** Decide whether the command should be chainable or non-chainable. Chainable commands can be chained together to form a sequence of actions, while non-chainable commands return a value.

3. **Command Structure:** Use the `Cypress.Commands.add()` method to define the command's structure. Provide a command name, a callback function for the command's logic, and optional options to configure the command's behavior.

4. **Accessing the Subject:** Use the `subject` property within the command's callback function to access the subject of the previous command in the chain.

5. **Returning Values:** Chainable commands should return a Cypress chainable object, while non-chainable commands can return any value.


**Example Custom Command:**

```javascript
// cypress/support/commands.js

Cypress.Commands.add('login', (username, password) => {
  cy.visit('/login');
  cy.get('#username').type(username);
  cy.get('#password').type(password);

**Tell me about `memory management` in javascript?**  
Memory management in JavaScript is the process of allocating and deallocating memory for objects during the execution of a program. JavaScript uses a garbage collector (GC) to automatically manage memory, freeing up unused memory to prevent memory leaks and improve overall performance.

**Key Concepts in JavaScript Memory Management:**

1. **Heap:** The heap is a dynamic memory space where objects are allocated during runtime. When an object is created, the JavaScript engine allocates memory for it on the heap.

2. **Stack:** The stack is a data structure used to store local variables, function arguments, and call stack frames. The stack is statically allocated and has limited memory.

3. **Garbage Collector (GC):** The GC is responsible for identifying and reclaiming unused memory on the heap. It periodically scans the heap to find objects that are no longer referenced by any other objects, and it deallocates the memory occupied by those objects.

**Garbage Collection Algorithms:**

1. **Mark-and-Sweep:** The most common algorithm, it marks reachable objects and sweeps the heap to reclaim unreferenced objects.

2. **Reference Counting:** Each object maintains a reference count, and the object is garbage collected when the reference count reaches zero.

3. **Generational GC:** Divides the heap into generations, collecting younger generations more frequently to target short-lived objects.

**Impact of Garbage Collection:**

1. **Performance:** Garbage collection can impact performance, especially during GC cycles. Optimization techniques can help mitigate performance overhead.

2. **Memory Allocation:** Garbage collection can cause temporary memory spikes during allocation and de-allocation cycles.

3. **Predictability:** Garbage collection is non-deterministic, making it challenging to predict exact memory usage and performance.

4. **Large Objects:** Handling large objects can pose challenges for garbage collection, requiring careful memory management practices.

**Conclusion:**

Memory management is an essential aspect of JavaScript development, ensuring efficient resource utilization and preventing memory-related issues. Understanding the principles of garbage collection and implementing appropriate memory management practices is crucial for building high-performance and reliable JavaScript applications.

Types and interfaces are both fundamental concepts in TypeScript, used to define the structure and properties of objects. While they share similarities, they also have distinct characteristics and use cases.

**Types:**

- **Definition:** Types represent a broader concept in TypeScript, encompassing primitive types (number, string, boolean), union types, intersection types, type aliases, and more.

- **Purpose:** Types primarily serve as a mechanism to define the expected shape of data, ensuring type safety and preventing runtime errors. They enforce type compatibility and prevent assigning values of incompatible types to variables.

- **Example:**

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};
```

**Interfaces:**

- **Definition:** Interfaces are a specific type construct in TypeScript, representing a structured contract for objects. They define the properties and methods that an object must have.

- **Purpose:** Interfaces primarily focus on defining the shape of objects, emphasizing the structure and behavior they should exhibit. They act as blueprints for object creation and ensure that objects adhere to the specified contract.

- **Example:**

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  getName(): string;
  setEmail(email: string): void;
}
```

**Key Differences:**

- **Flexibility:** Types offer greater flexibility, allowing for more complex and nuanced type definitions, such as union types, intersection types, and type aliases.

- **Focus:** Interfaces focus specifically on defining the structure and behavior of objects, providing a more rigid contract for object creation.

- **Abstraction:** Interfaces can be used to define abstract classes, allowing for inheritance and more complex object hierarchies.

- **Implementation:** Types can be implemented directly, while interfaces require implementation by classes or objects.

**Use Cases:**

- **Types:** Use types for primitive data types, union types, intersection types, type aliases, and complex type expressions.

- **Interfaces:** Use interfaces for defining the structure and behavior of objects, enforcing type safety and ensuring consistent object creation.

- **Abstract Classes:** Use interfaces in conjunction with abstract classes to define abstract contracts and inheritance hierarchies.

**Explain `omit` , `partial` and `optional` in the typescript?**  
`Omit`, `Partial`, and `Optional` are utility types in TypeScript that provide specific functionalities related to object types. They allow you to modify or refine existing object types by adding, removing, or making properties optional.

**Omit**

The `Omit` utility type removes specified properties from an existing object type. It takes two type arguments: the original object type and a union of property keys to remove.

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type UserWithoutEmail = Omit<User, 'email'>; // Removes the 'email' property
```

**Partial**

The `Partial` utility type makes all properties of an existing object type optional. It takes a single type argument: the original object type.

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type PartialUser = Partial<User>; // All properties become optional
```

**Optional**

The `Optional` utility type makes a specific property of an existing object type optional. It takes two type arguments: the original object type and the property key to make optional.

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type UserWithOptionalEmail = Optional<User, 'email'>; // Makes 'email' optional
```

**Relationship between Omit, Partial, and Optional:**

- `Omit` removes properties explicitly, while `Partial` makes all properties optional implicitly.

- `Optional` makes a specific property optional, while `Partial` makes all properties optional.

**Explain the React `custom component library` as a `mono repo` and `external repo`?**  
Whether to organize your React custom component library as a monorepo or a separate repository depends on various factors, including the size and complexity of the library, the number of developers involved, and the desired level of code sharing and collaboration.

**Monorepo Structure:**

In a monorepo structure, all project code, including the component library, is housed in a single repository. This provides several advantages:

1. **Code Sharing:** Developers can easily share and reuse code between the component library and other parts of the application, promoting code consistency and maintainability.

2. **Centralized Dependency Management:** A monorepo simplifies dependency management, as all dependencies are managed within a single repository, reducing conflicts and version mismatches.

3. **Seamless Integration:** Integration between the component library and the application is seamless, as they reside in the same repository, facilitating testing and development workflows.

**Separate Repository Structure:**

Managing the component library as a separate repository also offers certain benefits:

1. **Focused Development:** Developers can focus on the component library's development without being distracted by other application concerns, potentially improving code quality and maintainability.

2. **Independent Releases:** The component library can be independently released and consumed by other projects, promoting its reusability and wider adoption.

3. **Encapsulation:** The component library's code is encapsulated in its own repository, reducing the risk of conflicts or unexpected changes affecting the application's core code.

**Tell me about the downsides of reactJS `compound component pattern`?**  
While the ReactJS compound component pattern offers several advantages, it also has some potential downsides that should be considered when deciding whether to use it:

1. **Increased Prop Drilling:** Compound components can lead to prop drilling, where props are passed down through multiple levels of nested components to reach the desired destination. This can make the code more verbose and difficult to understand, especially for larger nested structures.

2. **Tight Coupling:** Compound components can create tight coupling between components, making it difficult to reuse them independently. Modifying one component in a compound structure may require changes in other components, affecting their reusability.

3. **Styling Challenges:** Styling compound components can become complex, especially when dealing with nested components that have overlapping or conflicting styles. Managing styles across multiple levels of nesting can be challenging and may require additional tooling or styling approaches.

4. **Component Re-usability:** While compound components promote code reuse within the component itself, their reusability across different contexts may be limited due to their tightly coupled nature. Extracting and refactoring reusable components from a compound structure may require additional effort.

5. **Testing Complexity:** Testing complex compound components can be more challenging due to the nested structure and potential interactions between components. Thoroughly testing all possible scenarios and edge cases may require more effort and careful test design.

6. **Performance Overhead:** In some cases, compound components may introduce performance overhead due to the additional layer of nesting and potential re-renders caused by prop changes. This may be a concern for performance-critical applications.

To mitigate these downsides, consider the following strategies:

1. **Limit Nesting Depth:** Keep the nesting depth of compound components manageable to minimize prop drilling and maintain code readability.

2. **Context API for Shared State:** Utilize the React Context API to manage shared state across components, reducing the need for prop drilling.

3. **CSS Modules or Styled Components:** Employ CSS Modules or Styled Components to manage styles more effectively, preventing style conflicts and simplifying styling of nested components.

4. **Refactor for Re-usability:** Extract reusable components from compound structures to enhance their reusability across different contexts.

5. **Modular Testing:** Test compound components using a modular approach, breaking down the component into smaller units for easier testing and isolation of issues.

6. **Measure Performance Impact:** Monitor the performance impact of compound components and optimize them if necessary, especially for performance-critical sections of the application.

**Why did you use `graphQl` in your previous `React` project?**  
There are several compelling reasons to utilize GraphQL in a React project, including:

1. **Flexible Data Fetching:** GraphQL provides a flexible and declarative approach to data fetching, allowing developers to specify the exact data they need for a particular component or UI element. This eliminates the need for over-fetching and reduces the amount of data transferred between the client and server.

2. **Improved Developer Experience:** GraphQL's type system and schema make it easier for developers to understand the structure and relationships of data, reducing the time spent debugging and refactoring. The schema provides a clear contract between the client and server, ensuring data consistency and type safety.

3. **Strong Client-Server Separation:** GraphQL promotes a clear separation between the client and server, allowing for independent development and evolution of both layers. This decoupling simplifies development and enables the server to evolve without breaking existing client applications.

4. **Efficient Data Caching:** GraphQL's client-side caching capabilities allow for efficient data caching, reducing the number of network requests and improving performance. The normalized data structure in the cache facilitates efficient data retrieval and updates.

5. **Support for Multiple Clients:** GraphQL supports a variety of clients, including React, native mobile apps, and web browsers. This flexibility makes it a suitable choice for building applications that need to interact with different platforms and devices.

6. **Future-Proofing:** GraphQL has gained significant traction and adoption in the industry, making it a future-proof choice for building modern applications. Its widespread adoption and community support ensure its continued development and evolution.

**Compare `writing yml files` manually for pipelines and using tools like `jenkins`?**  
Whether to write a YAML file or use Jenkins depends on the specific task at hand. Both YAML and Jenkins have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice will vary depending on the situation.

**YAML files** are a simple and lightweight way to store data in a human-readable format. They are often used for configuration files, as they are easy to read and write and can be parsed by a variety of tools. However, YAML files are not well-suited for storing large amounts of data or for complex data structures.

**Jenkins** is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool that can be used to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software. It is a powerful tool that can be used to manage complex projects, but it can also be a bit overwhelming for beginners.

Here is a table summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach:

| Approach   | Strengths                               | Weaknesses                                                           |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| YAML files | Simple, lightweight, human-readable     | Not well-suited for large amounts of data or complex data structures |
| Jenkins    | Powerful, can automate complex projects | Can be overwhelming for beginners                                    |

**In general, you should use a YAML file if:**

* You need to store a small amount of data in a human-readable format.
* You need a simple and lightweight way to store data.
* You do not need to automate any complex processes.

**You should use Jenkins if:**

* You need to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software.
* You need to manage a complex project.
* You are comfortable using a command-line interface (CLI).

**How `javascript` works behind scenes?**  

JavaScript is a single-threaded, interpreted language that runs on the client-side, inside the user's web browser. This means that JavaScript code is executed line by line, and the browser waits for each line to finish executing before moving on to the next. JavaScript is also dynamically typed, meaning that variables do not need to be declared with a specific type before they are used.

When you load a JavaScript file in a web browser, the browser's JavaScript engine first parses the code and converts it into an intermediate representation called an abstract syntax tree (AST). The AST is then used to generate machine code that can be executed by the computer's CPU.

As JavaScript code is executed, the browser maintains a call stack, which keeps track of the currently executing functions. When a function is called, a new frame is added to the call stack. The frame contains the function's local variables, the values of the arguments passed to the function, and the location of the next line of code to be executed. When the function returns, its frame is removed from the call stack.

JavaScript also has a global execution context, which is an object that contains all of the global variables and functions. The global execution context is created when the JavaScript engine starts up, and it exists for the lifetime of the page.
