# Agile Methodologies

### Teams may encounter the need for "technical" user stories. Who decides the priority of these?
The tech lead or architect can work with the product owner to determine priority based on upcoming roadmap
needs and dependencies. The key is communication between the PO and tech team leads to ensure technical needs
are visible and prioritized appropriately to enable user-facing features.

### What is the Scrum Master's role during the daily stand-up?
Stand outside the circle of developers and listen for impediments. Overall, the Scrum Master facilitates the
daily stand-up to keep it short, productive, and worthwhile for the team. Their leadership enables inspection
and adaptation of the sprint execution.

### Which factor should not be considered during Sprint Planning?
The number of stories in the product backlog. In the other word, any factors that distract from the core goals
of Sprint Planning around committing to the team's sprint backlog are best excluded from the Planning process.
The team focuses on what they can accomplish in the sprint.

### A team member has been showing signs of great personal distress: crying at work, snapping at colleagues, having heated phone conversations. As Team Facilitator, what should you do?
Advise the PO as soon as possible. My goal is addressing the situation compassionately while maintaining team
cohesion. I would aim to get the individual appropriate help so they can cope with personal challenges and 
remain a contributing team member.

### Which statement describes the flow of work in the Scaled Agile Framework?
- [ ] It is a "push" system.
- [ ] It is "push" at the top and "pull" at the bottom.
- [ ] It is a "pull" system.
- [x] It is neither "push" nor "pull."

### What is the Product Owner's role in deciding the priority of work in the sprint backlog?
Noneâ€”the developers should prioritize the work in the sprint backlog. The Product Owner heavily influences
sprint backlog priority, but does not dictate it. They collaborate with the team to align on the highest
value scope to deliver.

### The Scaled Agile Framework advocates that, if you measure only one thing, what should you measure?
The cost of delay. SAFe's single recommended metric is to measure planned vs actual business value delivery
at PI boundaries. This provides insight into the organization's Agile program predictability.

### Why should you apply Weighted Shortest Job First?
To determine the economic sequencing of the backlog. WSJF allows Product Managers and EPIC owners to optimally
sequence initiatives based on the right balance of value and execution effort. This drives predictability,
efficiency, and customer-focused delivery.

### You have classified the features in your backlog according to risk and value. Which features should the development team work on first?
- [ ] low-value and high-risk
- [x] high-value and high-risk
- [ ] high-value and low-risk
- [ ] low-value and low-risk

### In the Scaled Agile Framework, what is the role of Enablers?
They help extend the Architectural Runway. Enablers ensure teams have the platforms, tools, knowledge, and
support needed to deliver value predictably and sustainably within the SAFe system.

### Which outcome is not expected of a Sprint Review?
- [ ] The team demonstrates its completed work.
- [x] The team reflects on how to improve its performance.
- [ ] Items in the backlog may be re-prioritized.
- [ ] Stakeholders ask questions about the completed and upcoming backlog items.

### What is not a technique used for splitting user stories?
- [ ] split by line-of-business
- [x] split compound user stories
- [ ] split by alternative paths
- [ ] split by interface

### Who decides what the team will work on?
A self-organizing team. The Development Team decides on the work as they are the ones completing it. But
there is heavy collaboration with the Product Owner to pick the highest priority items for the team to deliver.

### Which choice is not a Scrum value?
- [ ] focus
- [x] integrity
- [ ] courage
- [ ] commitment

### What should happen if the Product Owner does not accept a story by the end of the iteration?
The story should be shown to stakeholders for their feedback. The goal is to have a "done" increment at the end
of every sprint. The team and Product Owner should collaborate to get the story to an acceptable state, learning 
from the experience for future improvements.

### Which statement is not true about the product backlog?
- [x] It is a list of work items that are behind schedule.
- [ ] The items are maintained in priority order.
- [ ] Anyone on the team can propose an item for it.
- [ ] It includes all of the work to be done.

### A project has some major risks that the team wants to mitigate. What is the best way to monitor how well this effort is going?
- [ ] risk-based spike
- [ ] risk-adjusted backlog
- [ ] risk velocity chart
- [x] risk burndown graph

### The VP of Engineering wants to start giving out a "Team Member of the Sprint" award to recognize a top performer in each group. What advice should you give this VP?
- [ ] This is unhelpful unless there has been recent employee feedback indicating that people feel underappreciated.
- [ ] This is a good idea as long as a different person is recognized in each sprint.
- [ ] This is a good idea because awards can motivate people to do their best.
- [x] This is unhelpful because it can destroy the team unity essential to achieving high performance.

### What is a difference between a team's task board and a Kanban?
A Kanban has an explicit rule to limit WIP. a task board is sprint-specific for day-to-day task tracking, while
a Kanban provides a bigger picture view of process work-in-progress and flow. A team could use both simultaneously.

### The team complains that "things have been falling through the cracks lately." What should you do?
Conduct a workshop to identify all the things that need to be done and see who can help with each. The goal is
to uncover the specific gaps causing problems and implement just enough process improvements to close those holes.
Too much procedure can worse problems, so we want to target the areas that will make the most impact first.

### In Large-Scale Scrum, what is the recommended ratio of Scrum Masters to teams?
One Scrum Master can support one to three teams. LeSS recommends a gradual ratio of Scrum Masters to teams,
with 1:1 being the maximum and 1:3 or less being preferred for larger LeSS adoptions.

### In the Cynefin framework, where are "best practices" most appropriate?
- [ ] in the Complex regime
- [ ] in the Complicated regime
- [ ] in the Chaotic regime
- [x] in the Obvious regime

### A manager informs you that a developer from another team is between assignments, and she wants to place the developer on your team for a few sprints. What should you do?
Explain to the manager that this will be disruptive to the team and ask that another assignment be found.

### The Product Owner complains to you that the team is not working hard enough and they need to increase their velocity by at least 50%. Which action should you not take?
Share the feedback from the PO and challenge the team to increase their velocity.

### What is the name of the practice in which a cross-functional team collaborates intensively to develop a new product idea?
- [x] Hackathon
- [ ] Scrum at Scale
- [ ] Innovation and Planning
- [ ] Magnum Focus

### The team's manager wants to attend the Sprint Retrospective. What should you do?
Propose a different forum for the manager to meet with the team.

### Who is responsible for a Scrum team's performance?
- [ ] the team
- [x] the Scrum Master
- [ ] the Product Owner
- [ ] the Engineering Manager

### Which statement concerning small, frequent releases of software is true?
- [ ] The chance for rollback is high.
- [x] It typically requires a high degree of automation.
- [ ] The administrative costs are high.
- [ ] Backward compatibility may be jeopardized.

### What is the activity of clarifying and expanding user stories called?
- [ ] story point estimating
- [ ] Definition of Done
- [ ] user story expansion
- [x] backlog refinement

### Which strategy is preferred for development teams?
- [ ] Optimize for most work done.
- [ ] Maximize output and maximize outcome.
- [x] Maximize outcome while minimizing output.
- [ ] Optimize for resource utilization.
