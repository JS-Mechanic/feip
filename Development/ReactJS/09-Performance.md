**What are pure components?**  
Pure components in React are components that implement the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method to improve
performance. This method compares the current props and state to the next props and state, and determines whether
the component needs to be re-rendered. If the props and state have not changed, the component can skip the rendering
process.
