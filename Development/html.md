# HTML

**What is an iframe and how it works?**  
An iframe (inline frame) is an HTML document embedded inside another HTML document on a website. It allows you to
display another webpage within the current webpage.
```html
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="600" height="400"></iframe>
```

**Explain meta tags in html?**  
Meta tags provide metadata and information about a web page. They are not visible to users but are machine-readable.
meta tags provide structured data about the page content in a machine readable way, which is used by browsers, search
engines, social media to display and index pages properly. The most common ones are charset, description, keywords and
social meta tags.
```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
</head>
```

**What is the purpose of alt attribute on images?**  
The main purposes of alt text are to provide accessibility, improve SEO, and present context for an image to both
sighted and non-sighted users. Alt text is important for images that convey meaning and content.

**What is the difference between span and div?**  
`<span>` is inline, non-breaking, content grouping container while `<div>` is block-level, creates structure breaks,
visual/layout grouping container.

---

**How can I get indexed better by search engines?**  
It is possible to get indexed better by placing the following two statements in the <HEAD> part of your documents:
```html
<meta NAME="keywords" CONTENT="keyword1 keyword2 keyword3">
<meta NAME="description" CONTENT="This is the description of the site.">
```
Both may contain up to 1022 characters. If a keyword is used more than 7 times, the keywords tag will be ignored
altogether. Also, you cannot put markup (other than entities) in the description or keywords list.

**What are some of the key goals and motivations for the html5 specification?**  
Here are some of the key goals and motivations behind the HTML5 specification:
- Semantic markup - Provide more descriptive HTML tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>` etc. to better represent
  different content types. Help search engines understand the structure.
- Multimedia support - With HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` tags, native multimedia playback support without plugins.
- Connectivity - Features like WebSockets allow two-way communication between a browser and server for real-time apps.
- Offline storage - localStorage API allows web apps to store data locally in the browser and work offline.
- Hardware access - Browsers can access user hardware like camera, GPS, accelerometer using HTML5 APIs. Enables immersive web experiences.
- Device agnostic - Design websites/apps for any device like mobile, tablet, desktop. Meta tag for responsive design.
- Accessibility - ensures semantics and APIs consider disabilities and accessibility needs.

**How can I highlight text in html?**  
Using the `<mark>` tag:
```html
<p>Here is some <mark>highlighted text</mark> in a paragraph.</p>
```

- Using CSS:
```html
<p>This text is <span class="highlight">highlighted</span> with CSS.</p>

<style>
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
```

- Using JavaScript:
```js
// select element 
const text = document.getElementById("text");

// apply highlight
text.style.backgroundColor = "yellow"; 
```

**Briefly describe the correct usage of the following html5 semantic elements: `<header>` , `<article>` , `<section>` , `<footer>`?**  

- `<header>` - Represents a header section for the nearest section or the overall page. Typically, contains heading 
             elements, logo, introductory content. Goes inside `<body>`.
- `<article>` - Represents a self-contained content piece like a blog post, news article, user-submitted comment.
                Can have its own `<header>` and other semantic elements.
- `<section>` - Groups thematically related content together. Can contain headings, paragraphs, images etc. Used to
                divide up page content into meaningful sections.
- `<footer>` - Contains meta information about the nearest `<article>` or `<section>` element. Typically, has author, 
               copyright, related links.

Usage guidelines:  
- `<header>` and `<footer>` appear at the start/end of `<article>`, `<section>`, `<body>`.
- `<article>` is for standalone content pieces that make sense on their own.
- `<section>` splits up content in thematic groups. Don't overuse it.
- Multiple `<article>` elements can reside in a `<section>` and vice versa.

**What is character encoding in html?**  
Character encoding defines how text is represented digitally. Declaring the encoding helps avoid errors in text
interpretation and ensures multilingual support. `UTF-8` is the standard encoding for HTML pages.

---

**What is a self-closing tag?**  
A self-closing tag in HTML is a tag that does not require a separate closing tag. Some examples of self-closing tags:
- `<br>` - Adds a line break
- `<hr>` - Adds a horizontal line 
- `<img>` - Adds an image
- `<input>` - Defines an input field
- `<link>` - Defines a link to an external resource 
- `<meta>` - Defines metadata about the HTML document

To denote a tag is self-closing, a `/` is added before the final `>` of the opening tag. For example:
```html
<br />
<img src="image.jpg" />
```

**What is the difference between an attribute and a property in html?**  
The main differences between attributes and properties in HTML are:

- **Attributes**:  
  - Defined in HTML tags to provide additional information about elements
  - Provided as `name/value` pairs like `<a href="url">`
  - Attribute names and values are case-insensitive, e.g `<a href="Url">`
  - Values must be enclosed in quotes
  - Do not change after being set
  - Can only be accessed and updated via DOM methods

- **Properties**:  
  - Represent specific characteristics of DOM elements
  - Accessed via DOM properties like element.property
  - Names are case-sensitive
  - No quotes required for values
  - Can dynamically change via JavaScript
  - Reflect the current state of an element

**When is it appropriate to use the small element?**  
The `<small>` element in HTML is used to represent side-comments and small print, like disclaimers, caveats, 
legal restrictions, etc. Some common appropriate uses of the `<small>` element:
- Copyright information in the page footer:
```html
<small>Â© 2023 MyWebsite. All rights reserved.</small>
```
- Terms and conditions or disclaimers stating legal or other restrictions:
```html
<small>Prices subject to change without notice.</small>
```
- Fine print for citing sources or providing attributions:
```html
<small>Data source: ACME Research</small>
```
- De-emphasizing or offsetting secondary text like asides and advisory notes:
```html
<p>Best deals this week on headphones. <small>While supplies last.</small></p>
```

**Explain the differences between block elements and inline elements?**  
The main differences between block elements and inline elements in HTML are:
- **Block Elements:**
  - Take up the full width available by default
  - Force a line break before and after itself
  - Can set height and width values
  - Can have margins and paddings adjusted
  - Common block elements: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>-<h6>`, `<form>`

- **Inline Elements:**
  - Take up only the required width as per content
  - Do not force line breaks before or after
  - Cannot have fixed height and width
  - Horizontal margins and paddings only are applied
  - Common inline elements: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<strong>`


So in summary:
- Block elements consume full horizontal space and break the flow
- Inline elements consume only the needed width and don't break flow

**Explain almost standard, full standard and quirks mode in html?**  
Browsers can render web pages in different modes based on the presence and validity of the document type declaration
in HTML code. The three main rendering modes are:

1. Quirks Mode:
   - Browser renders page using an older box model and non-standard behavior.
   - Triggered when there is no doctype or invalid doctype.
   - Causes layout inconsistencies across browsers.
   - Should be avoided for web pages.

2. Almost Standards Mode:
   - Browser uses some error forgiveness and backward compatibility.
   - Triggered by older, transitional doctypes like HTML 4.01 Transitional.
   - May cause small quirks in layout across browsers.

3. Full Standards Mode:
   - Browser adheres strictly to HTML and CSS standards.
   - Triggered by HTML5 doctype `<!DOCTYPE html>`
   - Ensures consistent rendering across updated browsers.
   - Is the recommended mode for modern web pages.

Web pages should use the HTML5 doctype `<!DOCTYPE html>` to trigger full standards mode in browsers. This ensures
predictable and consistent rendering based on web standards.

**How do you set IE compatibility mode?**  
Here are a few ways to set IE compatibility mode in HTML pages:
- Add a meta tag to the head section of your HTML:
```html
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
```
- Use HTTP headers to force IE to render pages in the highest mode available:
```
X-UA-Compatible: IE=edge
```
- Add a command line parameter if opening the page locally in IE:
```
iexplore.exe -c "IE=EmulateIE7"
```
- Use the X-UA-Compatible attribute in the opening <html> tag:
```html
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" x-ua-compatible="IE=EmulateIE7">
```
- Set a registry key on the client machine to always use a specific version:
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION
```
The meta tag or HTTP header methods are the easiest and most reliable ways to force IE compatibility mode across all
clients. The version number can also be changed to emulate different versions of IE.

**Have you used different HTML templating language before?**  
Yes, I have experience with `JSX` HTML templating language. `React/JSX` is not a typical templating language but `JSX`
is a JavaScript extension that allows writing HTML templates within JavaScript code which promotes reusable UI components.

**How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?**  
Here are some common ways to serve a page with content in multiple languages:
- Build separate pages for each language and serve them based on the user's language preference, detected via browser settings or user selection. Eg: page.html, page-fr.html, page-es.html
- Use content negotiation via the Accept-Language header to serve different language versions based on the header value. The server can detect the preferred language and serve the appropriate content.
- Implement internationalization where string constants are stored in resource bundles based on language. The appropriate resource file can be served dynamically based on user's locale.
- Maintain strings/translations in a database and query/substitute them dynamically via a server side script when serving the page.
- Use client side translation by sending a single neutral language page and translating it to user's language via JavaScript by looking up strings in a JSON/XML dictionary.
- Maintain translations in a key-value JSON object and interpolate values dynamically on page render via a template engine like Handlebars.
- For static content, maintain multiple copies of pages and links to language alternatives using the lang attribute and hreflang tag.

The best approach depends on the application architecture, whether it is server side or client side rendered, if the
languages are known upfront or dynamic etc. A combination of static content, dynamic substitution and client side
translation often works best.

**How do you change the direction of html text?**  
There are a few different ways to change the text direction in HTML:
1. Use the `dir` attribute:
```html
<p dir="rtl">This text will go right to left</p>
```
The dir attribute can be set to "rtl" for right-to-left text or "ltr" for left-to-right.
2. Use the `bdo` tag:
```html
<bdo dir="rtl">This text will also go right to left</bdo>
```
3. Set the `direction` CSS property:
```css
p {
  direction: rtl;
}
```
4. Set the `lang` attribute on the HTML tag:
```html
<html lang="ar">
```
This will make right-to-left text automatic for languages like Arabic.
